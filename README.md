# WDI_PROJECT_2  
## A full-stack RESTful application with authentication   
This is version 2 of Can I Launch. I attempted the first build using Ruby on Rails in 2016, but that remained an unfinished project. The purpose of the website is to allow entrepreneurs and online business owners to get constructive feedback from fellow web-builders before they launch their sites. The following Stack was used to build this project: 

#### ExpressJS  
#### MongoDB with Mongoose ORM  
#### NodeJS  
#### SCSS

## Frontpage  
When each website is hovered, users can see the name and description of the site. This is achieved using Javascript show and hide elements. Submissions are only permitted if the user is registered and logged in.

## Challenges  
This is my first full-stack app, the entire project was completed within 4 days. The main challenges were getting everything connected in the MVC, as well as creating the hover effect and aligning elements on the homepage.
